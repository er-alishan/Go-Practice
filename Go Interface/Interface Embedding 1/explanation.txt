Explanation (Short)

We created two separate interfaces: Depositor and Withdrawer.
Then we created AccountOperations interface which embeds both.

ðŸ‘‰ Benefits of Embedding:
Code Reuse: No need to rewrite Deposit and Withdraw in the combined interface â€” embedding automatically includes them.
Scalability: If later we want a new feature like CheckBalance(), we can simply make a new interface BalanceChecker and embed it into AccountOperations without touching existing code.
